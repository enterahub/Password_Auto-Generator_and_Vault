# Password_Auto-Generator_and_Vault
This file can autogen very robust passcode for your social accounts and integrate all your login info in only one place(an encrypted file). Thus, this is a practical utility that eases netizens' lives. 

# Tips
- Please run files in the builtin terminals, rather than an IDE;
- e.g. "python3 autogen_complex_pwd.py", "python3 open_my_password_vault.py";
- Some parameters in "autogen_complex_pwd.py" can be changed, like the prefered length of the passwords generated. You need to explore yourself.
- If you are using this tool for the first time, the programme will automatically give you a new 10-digits passcode. This is the passcode for the password vault access, and in another word, this passcode controls all other passwords. Thus, store it safely.
- The use of this tool is very easy, as I used very conventional and easy-to-understand namings and comments.
- Happy surfing and stay safe.
